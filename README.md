# Chroma Images

Motivations:

-  Cleaner images
-  Smaller images
-  Regularly pached
-  SBOMs
-  Signed images
-  Rootless
-  Optimized for production workloads
-  Observability built-in
-  Configurable and efficient logging

The goal of the repo is to create a variety of Chroma container images for testing, experimentation and deployment.
